# Mii channel music but every X seconds, some notes are missing

Thank u/ZebiKun for this masterpiece. 

Script takes a midi file of the Mii theme song and plays it, but with some notes missing every specified time interval. To keep you on your toes, the exact interval it removes notes varies

Change "newtimestamp" for interval. Current is every 5 sec.
Change "modifynext" on line 21 to change how many notes it removes
